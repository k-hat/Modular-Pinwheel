This is a python program that draws a pinwheel like pattern that can be 
modified in real-time to create different designs.

It started out as a rendering of a basic pinwheel.  Then I played around with
rotating each of the 'spokes' of the wheel independently of the wheel's 
rotation. Changing the rate of the spokes' rotation, the wheel's rotation, and
the number of spokes allows you to create intriguing patterns.  It reminds me
of the spirograph drawing kit from the 1990's.  

Use the 1-8 keys to see some interesting presets if you don't wish to play
around with the program.

Pygame

Pygame is a package created for coding games.  It's used in this code to
facilitate drawing to the screen, managing and computing geometry of shapes, and
handling user input.

This version is intended for Windows and is untested on macOS. It will most
likely not run correctly.

An exe file is provided in the dist folder.
This exe works for windows 10, but not for Windows 7.  It should work for 
Windows 8 and 11, though it is untested.
